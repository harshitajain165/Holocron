Holocron is a riveting AR-based game on the theme of Star Wars where the player has to scan a set of images and then solve the riddles based on wordplays augmenting on them. The player has to clear numerous checkpoints to complete the game. Clearing each checkpoint increases the difficulty level of the riddles.

## Steps to play Holocron:-
:dart: Install the app and register and login to dive into the riddling world of Holocron. <br />
:dart: After logging in, you will be directed to the Home Page with three options infront of you:
- SCAN
- ANSWER
- EXIT
<br />
:dart: Click on the ‘SCAN’ option and direct the camera to the pictures one at a time in the first folder provided to you. <br />
:dart: Hold the camera steady at each picture for a while and on one particular picture out of the ten in a folder, a riddle will augment. <br />
:dart: To answer the riddle, go back to the Home Page and click on the ‘ANSWER’ option. <br />
:dart: Enter the answer to clear the 1st checkpoint. <br />
:dart: After clearing the first checkpoint, go back on the Home Page, scan the pictures in the 2nd folder, brainstorm over the augmented riddle and feed the answer of the second riddle. <br />
:dart: This way keep battling your way through riddle after riddle till you reach the final checkpoint.
